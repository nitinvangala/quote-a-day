                "Vince Lombardi understood the correct balance between loving your players and wanting to buddy up to them. He once said that a leader should never try to 'close the gap' between himself and his team. He should love his team, serve his team, and sacrifice for his team - but he should never try to be one of the guys.",
                "Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough.", 
                "There is something incredible about giving when it's our idea. Opening our eyes and ears to the people around us and asking 'How can we give?' is a profoundly life-giving and satisfying way to live.",
                "Happiness depends on how you balance your life's equations between positive and negative experiences and attitudes.",
                "If one waits for the spectacular moments, the 'ooh, ahh' moments to spark a little gratitude, there may be a long wait between those thankful moments.", 
                "When people are determined they can overcome anything.", 
                "Being thankful should be an unwritten rule of life because there are several things to be thankful for.", 
                "Controlling your time helps overcome frustration and brings life into balance and order, giving you the feeling of control and poise."
